Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> 
is the standard markup language for 
<strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> <br>
and web applications.Web browsers receive HTML documents 
from a web server or from local storage <br>and render them 
into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure 
of a web page semantically and <br>originally included cues for the 
appearance of the document.</p>

<p>HTML elements are the building 
blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, 
such as interactive forms, <br>may be embedded into the rendered page. 
It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting 
structural semantics for text <br>such as headings, paragraphs, lists, 
links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, 
written using angle brackets. </p>
